*Installation*
================
It's a greasemonkey script. If you're running chrome, you just open it in chrome, and refresh facebook. Otherwise, install it from the greasemonkey extension in firefox. I don't know if that works, only tested in chrome. Sure it does though. Disregarding the fact it doesn't really work in chrome.
